- Go project will be of 2 types: 

    1. Executable - that we run. we write and and execute in the same device
    2. Libraries/packages - the are the codes which are imported inro other peoples go projects.

- To initialize the project:

    go mod init <project_name>/github_link_name
    // Typical look: go mod init github.com/<org_name>/<project>

- To download all the dependencies

    go get <package_name> // for indivisual dependency
    go mod download // for multiple 

- the project files which are built follow the standard approach and some try to match the folder name also:

    <file_name>.go =>

    package <file_name>

    func <file_name>(){
        fmt.Print(users)
    }

- when u run: go build <file_name>.go
    it builds a <file_name>.exe file which is a executable file containing binary values, and this file is a executable binary.

- standard practice: while naming the packages cannot name them by using capital letters, and name should be as short as possible

- the standard practice we use the end values of the packages:
    package main

    import (
    	"fmt"  
    	"math/rand"
    ) 

    func main() {
    	fmt.Println("hello")
    	fmt.Println("Printing", rand.Intn(10))
    }

- whenever u initialize the values they immediatly have the values of their "zeroth state", 
    bool->false
    int->0
    string-> print nothing

- Datatypes
    1. Basic - number, string, bool
    2. Aggregrat - array(with single datatype)(Homogeneous), Struct(with multiple datatypes)(heterogeneous) 
    3. Reference datatypes - Pointers, slices, functions, chanels, maps (they dont have data, they just refer the data)
    4. Interfaces 

- defer fmt.Println("world")
	fmt.Println("hello") // prints Hello world
	// defer calculates the values and stores in a stack where its shows the results after the executions of the main function

- // array - static typed
	var a [2]string
	// size is the part of array type
	a[0] = "hello"
	a[1] = "world"
	fmt.Println(a[0], a[1])
	fmt.Println(a)

	primes :=[6]int{2,3,5,7,11,13}
	fmt.Println(primes)
