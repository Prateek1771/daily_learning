============================================================

main.go is the main file:
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
	    // entry point
	    fmt.Println("hello world")
    }

    - to run this file we need to build it first
        - go build <filename>  // after this a main.exe file will appear, to run the project just execute the file(main.exe)
        - ./main          // this executes the project
        - go run <filepath/filename> // another method to run the code
